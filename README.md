# Day 06 - Go Intensive
## Fortress of Solitude

## Chapter I
### General rules

- Your programs should not quit unexpectedly (giving an error on a valid input).
  If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will
  receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this
  work won't have to be submitted and won't be graded. It will give you a
  chance to easily test your work and your peers' work. You will find those
  tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you
  are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
- Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git
  repository will be graded.
- If your code is using external dependencies, it should use Go Modules
  for managing them


## Chapter II
### Rules of the day

- You should only turn in *.go files and (in case of external dependencies)
  go.mod + go.sum
- Your code for this task should be buildable with just go build
- Additional steps, e.g. for creating tables in a database, should be 
  included in admin_credentials.txt


## Chapter III
### Intro

So - this is it! You've just got superpowers! And, as a new superhero, 
you definitely need to think about your street cred and overall recognition, 
don't you think?

Fireballs - check! Almost indecently tight leotard - check! 
Secret base - oh yeah, baby!

Anything else you forgot? Any other shenanigans to perform? OH WAIT~


## Chapter IV
### Exercise 00: Amazing Logo

The only requirement here is to generate an awesome logo! It should be 
a 300x300px PNG file named 'amazing_logo.png'. Make it as cool as you can!

Image should appear in the same directory as the launched binary executable 
after compiling.

NOTE: you shouldn't cheat and download anything from the internet in your code. 
Just don't rely on any external sources and unleash your fantasy in programming! 
Also, just plain single color or transparent logo doesn't count!


## Chapter V
## Exercise 01: Place for Your Thoughts

Okay, so what else do you need now? A website, of course! It should be a 
blog where everybody will be able to read your ideas on the world improvement. 
Here is a list of features it should have:

- Database (you should use PostgreSQL)
- Admin panel (on '/admin' endpoint) where only you can login with just a 
  form for posting new articles (let's forget about editing old ones for now,
  superheroes don't ever look back)
- Basic markdown support (so it can at least show "###" headers and links in 
  generated HTML)
- Pagination (show no more than 3 thoughts on one page for people to not get 
  too much of your awesomeness)
- Application UI should use port 8888

All additional files (images, css, js if you decide to use any of those) 
should be submitted as a zip file to be unpacked in the same directory as 
binary itself, resulting into something like this:

```
  ├── css
  │ └── main.css
  ├── images
  │ └── my_cat.png
  ├── js
  │ └── scripts.js
  └── myblog-binary
```

Admin credentials for posting access (login and password) and database 
credentials (database name and user) should be submitted separately as well 
in a file called admin_credentials.txt. If there are additional commands to 
be run to create tables in a database, put them into the same file.

Main page should include your logo from EX00, links to articles and 
(optionally) some short preview of their content, as well as pagination (if 
there are more than 3 articles in a database).

When clicking a link to article, user should get to a page with a rendered 
markdown text and a single "Back" link which brings him/her back to main page.


## Chapter VI
### Exercise 02: Haters Gonna Hate

Now, when you already have a cool website, let's update it a little and 
protect ourselves from the villains trying to bring it down! All you need to 
do is implement rate limiting, so if there are more than a hundred clients 
per second trying to access it, they should get a "429 Too Many Requests" 
response. Of course when you're getting more famous we'll raise that limit! 
It's just for testing for now.
